ArduinoMicroAccelTempMicWithLCD


I wanted to do a project with an LCD and thought writing accelerometer data for a device you can hold - might be a good way to better intuit accelerometer values.
I got that wired up an decided to throw on an analog temp sensor and a microphone.

I use the mic as a switch to toggle between sensor displays.

Components:

Arduino Micro : https://www.adafruit.com/products/1086
Accelerometer : https://www.adafruit.com/product/163
Mic : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063
Temp : https://www.adafruit.com/products/374
LCD :  https://www.adafruit.com/product/358

At the initial phase of just LCD and accelerometer, it looked like this:
