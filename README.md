Arduino Micro with ADXL345 Accelerometer, Analog Temp, and Mic with color LCD


I wanted to do a project with an LCD and thought writing accelerometer data for a device you can hold - might be a good way to better intuit accelerometer values.
I got that wired up and decided to throw on an analog temp sensor and a microphone.

I use the mic as a switch to toggle between sensor displays.

At the initial phase of just LCD and accelerometer, it looked like this:
