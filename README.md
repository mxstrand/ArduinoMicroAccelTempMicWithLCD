Arduino Micro with ADXL345 Accelerometer, Analog Temp, and Mic with color LCD


I wanted to do a project with an LCD and thought writing accelerometer data for a device you can hold - might be a good way to better intuit accelerometer values.
I got that wired up an decided to throw on an analog temp sensor and a microphone.

I use the mic as a switch to toggle between sensor displays.

Components:

 1. Arduino Micro : https://www.adafruit.com/products/1086
 2. Accelerometer : https://www.adafruit.com/product/163
 3. Mic : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063
 4. Temp : https://www.adafruit.com/products/374
 5. LCD :  https://www.adafruit.com/product/358


At the initial phase of just LCD and accelerometer, it looked like this:
